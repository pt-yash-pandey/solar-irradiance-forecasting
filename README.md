# Solar Irradiance Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze solar irradiance data from the year 2019. The provided dataset (`2019.csv`) contains measurements of solar irradiance recorded at regular intervals throughout the year. 

## Dataset Description

The dataset (`2019.csv`) includes the following columns:

- **Timestamp**: The date and time of the measurement.
- **Solar Irradiance (W/m^2)**: The measured solar irradiance in watts per square meter.

## Installation

To run the analysis, you will need Python and several libraries. You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage

You can use the provided Jupyter notebook (`solar_irradiance_analysis.ipynb`) to perform various analyses on the solar irradiance data. The notebook includes code snippets and explanations to guide you through the process.

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solar-irradiance-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd solar-irradiance-project
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open the `solar_irradiance_analysis.ipynb` notebook and execute the cells sequentially to analyze the data.

## Analysis

The analysis includes but is not limited to:

- Visualizing the distribution of solar irradiance measurements.
- Identifying trends and patterns in solar irradiance over different time periods.
- Correlating solar irradiance with other relevant factors, if applicable.
- Generating insights and conclusions based on the analysis.
